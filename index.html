<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<h3 id="machine-to-do-your-work">Machine to do your work:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We are providing access to a Linode cloud instance (the Linode machine). You
   can do work there by SSH or SSHFS. You'll need to access the cloud instance
   to submit your benchmarks and see how you are doing relative to the rest of
   the class. To access the machine by SSH:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
   $ ssh B1234567890@96.126.110.231</code></p>
<p>where B1234567890 is your banner ID. Your password is your banner ID as well.
   Please change your password when you first log in:</p>
<p><code>bash
   $ passwd</code>
   which will prompt you in the following way:</p>
<p><code>bash
   (current) UNIX password:
   Enter new UNIX password:
   Retype new UNIX password:
   passwd: password updated successfully</code></p>
<ol>
<li>You can also do your work locally, you're going to need Java JDK and JRE.
   You'll also need Python3 and Pandas if you want to generate data other than
   the one we included in the repo.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="git-setup">Git Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you are reading this you must have setup Github and the Github classroom
   code. Great! You'll need to set this up in both your local and the Linode
   machine.</li>
<li>You'll find your remote repos as below. Note that the remote repo below uses
   <code>https</code>.  If you want to setup SSH, feel free. Also note that yourusername
   will be replaced with your Github user name.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>bash
$ git remote --v
origin  https://github.com/brown-cs127/indexing-youusername.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/brown-cs127/indexing-youusername.git (push)</code></p>
<ol>
<li>We want to add a remote repo so that you can get updates to the code that we
   make:</li>

$ git pull upstream master    # pull from changes from our repo</code></p>
<ol>
<li>If you are working in the machine we provided, all the software required
   (Java and Python) are available. If you are working locally, you'll need to
   install the Java JDK and JRE and Python3. You'll also need to install
   Python's Pandas package.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Franco's going to have tech hours throughout the week to help with setup</strong></p>

</ol>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<h3 id="summary-of-files">Summary of files</h3>
<p>Although it seems like there's alot of code, most of it is testing code!  The
goal of the code base is to keep things small and streamlined. This allows you
the student to go bazinga(s) over modifications and optimizations without
fear that you shouldn't modify some file.</p>
<p>The files you can (and likely should modify) are the following:
* <code>Main.java</code>: contains the main entry point to the code
* <code>BPlusTree.java</code>: contains the B+ tree skeleton class. This compiles but
doesn't work! You'll need to fill in the functions. We suggest some functions
for you to make.
* <code>Column.java</code>: contains the Column class. You'll modify this to include your
indexing mechanism after you've built your B+ tree.
* <code>Table.java</code>: contains the Table class. Defines the interfaces that allow you
to perform range queries on the table class. You'll have to change the
implementation of these methods to account for any changes you've made in the
other files.</p>
<p>You can make any changes to the files above so long as you follow the
instructions on what you are able to change and not. You can also make new Java
files that contain your own code.</p>
<p>The following files don't need to be changed but you should know what they are
used for. It might be helpful to change some of them but it wouldnt be
necessary.
* <code>Tuple.java</code>: contains the definition of a Tuple. This is the logical Tuple
outside of the table. The Table takes an instance of a Tuple and stores the
information in the Tuple, not necessarily using the instance of the Tuple.
* <code>TupleIDSet.java</code>: contains the definition of a set of Tuple IDS (Integers).
This is what is returned from a filter predicate, for example, the Tuple IDs
where attribute A is between some value x and y.
* <code>Filter.java</code>: contains the definition for a filter predicate. It's passed
into the <code>Table.filter()</code> method so that the method can execute the code.
* <code>MaterializedResults.java</code>: contains the definition for the
MaterializedResults class. An instance of this is returned when you want to get
the tuples from a set of tuple IDs.</p>
<p>The following files deal with tests. Do not edit these files!:
* <code>Benchmarks.java</code>: Contains benchmarking code where we measure the query
response time of your Table.
* <code>BPlusTreeTests.java</code>: Tests the correctness of your B+ tree. It puts and
removes values from your B+ tree. It also checks the internal node structure of
your B+ tree using the <code>INodeValidator</code> class defined in this file.
* <code>TableTests.java</code>: Checks that the table's functions are return the right
values.</p>
<h3 id="what-works-and-what-doesnt">What works and what doesn't?</h3>
<p>We've written the table so that it works at a very fundamental level. You can
confirm this by running <code>make testtable</code> as described below. To ensure
correctness you should modify the code while ensuring the Table's tests stay
correct.</p>
<p>We've given you skeleton code for the B+ tree and so this definitely doesn't
work.</p>
<h2 id="building-and-running">Building and Running</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the code is written in Java. As such, you need the Java JDK. We
use version 11. I'm no Java programmer so I use a Makefile.</p>
<p>To compile the code:</p>
<p><code>bash
make</code></p>
<p>We included some initial test data in your repo so you don't need to run this.
However, if you need to generate the test data, you'll need Python3 and Pandas
and run:</p>
<p><code>bash
make data</code></p>
<p>To run the tests the code:</p>
<p><code>bash
make testtable</code></p>
<p><code>bash
make testtree</code></p>
<p>To run the benchmarks:</p>
<p><code>bash
make bench</code></p>
<p>To clean up class files:</p>
<p><code>bash
make clean</code></p>
<h2 id="tests-for-correctness">Tests for Correctness</h2>
<h3 id="b-tree">B+ Tree</h3>
<p>You can see the tests for correctness in <code>BPlusTreeTests.java</code>. If you run this,
these tests will fail. You'll need to define your B+ tree first! It does the
following checks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inserts data into the tree</li>
<li>Most of the data from the tree</li>
<li>Inserts and removes data from the tree for some ratio</li>
<li>Checks internal nodes for children relationships. Note, that this is a very
   purposely loose check because there are many ways of writing a B+ tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the tree performed correctly, you'll see something similar to the following:</p>
<p><code>bash
$ make testtree
Seed for random generator: 0
Successfully inserted: 1000 items
Successfully got all 1000 expected values
Successfully deleted: 500 items with 500 items remaining
Successfully written 806 and deleted 194 and 1000 operations with writeRatio 80
Successfully validated tree</code></p>
<h3 id="table-tests">Table Tests</h3>
<p>You can see the tests for correctness for the Table in the <code>TableTests.java</code>. To
test for correctness, it reads the file <code>data</code> we gave you in the
<code>data\_validation</code> directory. It writes results to the
<code>data\_validation/results</code> directory. It then calls a python script to compare
your results to the data in <code>data\_validation/expected</code> directory.</p>
<p>It checks to make sure your implementation is correct for the following table
methods:
* <code>Table.insert</code>
* <code>Table.load</code>
* <code>Table.filter</code>
* <code>Table.update</code>
* <code>Table.delete</code></p>
<p>In doing so, it also ensures that method for <code>Table.materialize</code> works
correctly.</p>
<h3 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h3>
<p>Arguably equivalent in importance to correctness is performance. Indices are
built to ensure performant databases. As such, we provide a benchmarking
framework to estimate how fast your implementations run. You can run these
benchmarks by running <code>make bench</code></p>
<p>You can find the benchmarks in the file <code>benchmark_results.txt</code>. To register
these benchmarks in the class's benchmarks, you'll need to run this in the
Linode machine we provided.</p>
<h2 id="an-implementation-overview">An implementation overview</h2>
<p>The code implements a simple column-oriented <code>Table</code> supporting only the Integer
data type. This <code>Table</code> supports a few essential database operations: inserts,
deletes, filters, and updates. In addition, the table supports a new operator
you might not have seen called "materialize". These are discussed below.</p>
<h3 id="tuples">Tuples</h3>
<p><code>Tuple.java</code> contains the code for a <code>Tuple</code>. You'll see that the <code>Tuple</code> class
is simply a hashtable where the key is a String, and the value is an Integer.
The key is the attribute, and the value is well, the value of that attribute.
For example, the code below inserts an instance of a <code>Tuple</code> into the table
<code>someTable</code>. This <code>Tuple</code> has two attributes: "A" = 1, and "B" = 2.</p>
<p><code>Java
Tuple t = new Tuple();
t.put("A", 1);
t.put("B", 2);
some`Table`.insert(t1);</code></p>
<h3 id="columns">Columns</h3>
<p><code>Columns.java</code> contains the code for the <em>physical representation</em> for the
<em>logical attribute</em> in a <code>Table</code>. Because the <code>Table</code> is a column-oriented data
storage scheme, the set of values of a given attribute is stored as an array in
contiguous memory. You'll see that this column is simply an <code>Vector</code> of
Integers.</p>
<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
<p><code>Table.java</code> contains a bulk of the initial code. It has several internal
variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String name</code> is the name of the <code>Table</code>. It's not used much but there anyways
for future use.</li>
<li><code>Hashtable&lt;String, Column&gt; attributes</code> is the collection of columns and the
attribute name corresponding to those columns.</li>
<li><code>Vector&lt;Boolean&gt; valid</code> is an array that indicates whether a tuple is valid
or not (for example, when the tuple is deleted)</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally, the column-oriented storage allows the <code>Table</code> to use the position
of a tuple in its column as the tuple's id. In the code below, <code>Tuple</code> t1 will
be referenced internally with id 0, t2 with id 1, and t3 with id 2. <code>Tuple</code> t2's
value for attribute "A" can be accessed in the Column corresponding to attribute
A equivalent to <code>columnA[0]</code>.</p>
<p>```Java</p>
<p>// Instantiate a new table with two attribtues "A" and "B".
HashSet<String> cols = new HashSet<String>();
cols.add("A");
cols.add("B");
Table someTable = new Table("test_table", cols);</p>
<p>// Insert tuples into the Table
Tuple t1 = new Tuple();
t1.put("A", 1);
t1.put("B", 2);
someTable.insert(t1);</p>
<p>Tuple t2 = new Tuple();
t2.put("A", 1);
t2.put("B", 3);
someTable.insert(t2);</p>
<p>Tuple t3 = new Tuple();
t3.put("A", 3);
t3.put("B", 1);
someTable.insert(t3);
```</p>
<p>The <code>Table</code> class provides several methods we describe below.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Inserts a <code>Tuple</code> into the table by appending the values of the
tuple to each of the columns. Internally marks that tuple as valid by also
pushing <code>true</code> into the <code>valid</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>delete</strong>: Given a set of <code>Tuple</code>s' IDs, marks the <code>Tuple</code>s' as invalid by
setting the <code>valid</code> variable for that id as <code>false</code>. <em>Note:</em> this extremely
naive approach is done on purpose. At some point, there are performance
implications to not garbage collecting or physically deleting these entries.</p>
<p><strong>filter</strong>: Given a <code>Filter</code>, returns the <code>HashSet</code> of valid tuple IDs that
qualify. See the description of a <code>Filter</code> later in the document.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>: Given a a set of <code>Tuple</code>s' IDs, an attribute, and value, updates the
<code>Tuple</code>s attribute to the given value.</p>
<p><strong>materializeResults</strong>: Given a set of attributes and a set of valid tuple ids
(<code>Integer</code>s), returns a <code>MaterializedResults</code> of the attributes and tuples
requested. This is particularly necessary for column stores because a <code>Tuple</code>'s
values are stored separately in columns. This operation is also quite expensive
and is typically only used as the very last step in the query plan. This
technique is called <em>late tuple materialization</em>. We describe a
<code>MaterializedView</code> later in the document.</p>
<p><strong>load</strong>: Given a list of <code>Tuple</code>s, load all of these tuples into the Table.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: the <code>load</code> method currently calls <code>insert</code> each time. This <em>might</em> be
an issue when you are building an index...</p>
<h3 id="other-stuff-relating-to-tuples-columns-and-tables">Other stuff relating to Tuples, Columns, and Tables</h3>
<p><strong>Filter</strong>: A recursive data structure. At the bottom of the recursion, a Filter
contains an <code>attribute</code>, a <code>low</code>, and a <code>high</code> value. If the low and high values
are present, then it's a range filter <code>low &lt;= x &lt;= high</code>. Note that if <code>low =
high</code>, then this is equivalent to an equality filter, it's an equality filter.
If <code>high</code> is null and <code>low</code> is present, then this is a query is equivalent to `x</p>
<blockquote>
<p>= low<code>. If vice versa, then it's</code>x &lt;= high`.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>MaterializedResults</strong>: This is a very lightweight wrapper around
<code>Vector&lt;Tuple&gt;</code>. To generate this list you'll need to iterate over the columns
in the <code>Table</code> and put together the tuples as previously descibed.</p>
<h3 id="indexes-and-b-tree">Indexes and B+ Tree</h3>
<p>The B+ tree code in <code>BPlusTree.java</code> currently stands alone and is unused
anywhere else besides the tests. After completing the B+ tree code, you're going
to need to write code to use the B+ tree as an index for columns in your table.</p>
<h4 id="other-indexes">Other indexes</h4>
<p>At the end of the project, you're going to experiment with one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An significant optimization to your B+ tree. Note that this should
   fundamentally change how your B+ tree works. Minor optimizations such as
   changing branching factor doesn't count!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alternative indexing scheme. We'll be discussing this as we progress in
   class. Some options include LSM Trees, Bitmap Indexes, HashMaps. In all
   cases, you DON'T need to implement these yourself - you can use anything
   provided in the Java standard library. You're simply going to need to write
   code on how to use these data structures as an index.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if you use a HashMap, Java has a bunch of HashMap
   implementations. You can choose one and write code to use it as an index for
   your column or table.</p>
<h2 id="phases">Phases</h2>
<p>Each phase requires you to check in with a TA. We'll release sign-in sheets for
when these check-ins are going to occur.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-code-base-and-b-tree">Phase #1: Code base and B+ Tree</h3>
<p>There are two tasks to the first phase:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, get familiar with the codebase. We are providing two recitations to
   walk through the codebase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, write the B+ tree code.  Want to know how a B+ tree works in a fun
   and interactive visualization? Check this out:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-bind-b-tree-to-your-table">Phase #2: Bind B+ Tree to your table</h3>
<p>You're going to need to bind your BPlusTree code into your Table and modify your
Table to use the B+ Tree. You're going to have to use this as a primary
(clustered) index, and as a secondary index.</p>
<h3 id="phase-3-investigate-alternative-indexing-schemes">Phase #3: Investigate alternative indexing schemes</h3>
<p>We discussed "Other indexes" previously. That falls in this phase. We also want
you to write a one page summary of what you did and why. You should confirm that
there is some gain to your alternative indexing scheme by comparing benchmark
results. If it's actually slower, then also explain why.</p>
